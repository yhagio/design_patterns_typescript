# Composite

## What is it?

- Allows you to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly
- They allow you to represent part-whole hierarchies
  - Components can be further divided into smaller components
- You can structure data, or represent the inner working of every part of a whole
  object individually

## Intent

- Compose objects into tree structures to represent whole-part hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
- Recursive composition
- "Directories contain entries, each of which could be a directory."
- 1-to-many "has a" up the "is a" hierarchy

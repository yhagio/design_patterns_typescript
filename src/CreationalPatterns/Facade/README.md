# Facade

## Intent

- Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
- Wrap a complicated subsystem with a simpler interface.

i.e.

Can I withdrawal \$50 from the bank?

- Check if the checking account is valid
- Check if the security code is valid
- Check if funds are available
- Make changes accordingly

# Visitor

## Intent

- Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
- The classic technique for recovering lost type information.
- Do the right thing based on the type of two objects.
- Double dispatch
- You can make completely different methods depending on the class used
- Allows you to define external classes that can extend other classes without majorly editing them

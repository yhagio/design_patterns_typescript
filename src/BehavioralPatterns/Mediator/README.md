# Mediator

## Intent

- Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently.
- Design an intermediary to decouple many peers.
- Promote the many-to-many relationships between interacting peers to "full object status".

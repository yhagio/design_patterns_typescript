# Template Method

## Intent

- Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to client subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
- Base class declares algorithm 'placeholders', and derived classes implement the placeholders.

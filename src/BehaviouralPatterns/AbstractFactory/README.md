# Abstract Factory

- It provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- Use when you have many objects that can be added, or changed dynamically during runtime.
- You can model anything you can think of and have those objects interact through common interface.

But, can be very complicated, so watch out!
